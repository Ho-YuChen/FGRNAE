668	"GPC1"	10090.ENSMUSP00000088833	Prnp	Major prion protein; Its primary physiological function is unclear. May play a role in neuronal development and synaptic plasticity. May be required for neuronal myelin sheath maintenance. May promote myelin homeostasis through acting as a agonist for ADGRG6 receptor. May play a role in iron uptake and iron homeostasis. Soluble oligomers are toxic to cultured neuroblastoma cells and induce apoptosis (in vitro) (By similarity). Association with GPC1 (via its heparan sulfate chains) targets PRNP to lipid rafts. Also provides Cu(2+) or ZN(2+) for the ascorbate-mediated GPC1 deaminase degr [...] 
669	"FAM171B"	10090.ENSMUSP00000062702	Fam171b	Protein FAM171B; Family with sequence similarity 171, member B; Belongs to the FAM171 family
672	"TTLL7"	10090.ENSMUSP00000129369	Ttll7	Tubulin polyglutamylase TTLL7; Polyglutamylase which preferentially modifies beta- tubulin. Mediates both ATP-dependent initiation and elongation of polyglutamylation of microtubules. Required for neurite growth; responsible for the strong increase in tubulin polyglutamylation during postnatal neuronal maturation
673	"CIPC"	10090.ENSMUSP00000141049	Cipc	CLOCK-interacting pacemaker; Transcriptional repressor which may act as a negative- feedback regulator of CLOCK-ARNTL/BMAL1 transcriptional activity in the circadian-clock mechanism. May stimulate ARNTL/BMAL1- dependent phosphorylation of CLOCK. However, the physiogical relevance of these observations is unsure, since experiments in knockout mice showed that CIPC is not critially required for basic circadian clock
675	"SLA"	10090.ENSMUSP00000002327	Def6	Differentially expressed in FDCP 6; Phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate-dependent guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) which plays a role in the activation of Rho GTPases RAC1, RhoA and CDC42. Can regulate cell morphology in cooperation with activated RAC1. Plays a role in Th2 (T helper cells) development and/or activation, perhaps by interfering with ZAP70 signaling. Required for optimal T-cell effector function, lymphocyte homeostasis and the prevention of systemic autoimmunity (By similarity)
685	"RORA"	10090.ENSMUSP00000005606	Prkaca	cAMP-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit alpha; Phosphorylates a large number of substrates in the cytoplasm and the nucleus.

Required for kinetochore integrity and the organization of stable microtubule binding sites in the outer plate of the kinetochore. The NDC80 complex synergistically enhances the affinity of the SKA1 complex for microtubules and may allow the NDC80 complex to track depolymerizing microtubules; Belongs to the SPC24 family
